Project Overview:

The project involves creating a data analytics dashboard for Blinkit, an Indian e-commerce platform. The goal was to visualize key business metrics to help stakeholders make informed decisions based on data. The project required using Excel for data manipulation and Power BI for building the interactive dashboard.

Tools Used:

Excel: Used for initial data cleaning, processing, and preparation. Excel was essential for handling raw data, performing basic calculations, and organizing the dataset into a format suitable for visualization.

Power BI: Utilized for creating an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Power BI enabled the integration of multiple data sources, the creation of dynamic charts and graphs, and the implementation of slicers for filtering data by different criteria.

Key Metrics and Visualizations:

Total Sales: This metric provides an overview of the sales performance across all outlets. It helps in understanding overall revenue generation.

Average Sales: This shows the average sales per outlet, providing insights into how different outlets are performing on average.

Number of Items Sold: This metric tracks the quantity of items sold across outlets, helping to identify high-performing products and trends.

Average Rating: Visualizing customer ratings allows for assessing the quality of products and services, which is crucial for customer satisfaction and retention.

Fat Content by Outlet Item Type: This analysis helps understand the distribution of fat content in products, which could be important for health-conscious consumers or regulatory compliance.

Outlet Establishment: This visualization shows data based on the year of establishment of outlets, helping to correlate outlet age with sales performance.

Outlet Size: This examines how the physical size of the outlet impacts sales and customer engagement.

Outlet Location: This helps in analyzing geographical trends and the impact of location on sales and customer preferences.

Outlet Type: Different types of outlets (e.g., grocery stores, supermarkets) are compared to see which types are more successful.

Outcome:

The completed dashboard provides a comprehensive view of Blinkit's operations, offering stakeholders the ability to explore data from multiple angles. The dashboard facilitates better decision-making by providing clear and actionable insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and product distribution.
